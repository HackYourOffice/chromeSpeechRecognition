you can try out this directly https://hackyouroffice.github.io/chromeSpeechRecognition/index.html[here] (works only in chrome)

* firefox is mission speech recognition
* chromium is mission speech output

You can click on *ask* to make to make a single request. Or you click on *start* to have a continuous listening where you can start with "Hallo Computer" a small conversation.
In both cases "Hilfe" will provide you with a list of commands you can ask. Some of the commands are only working inside the synyx-network.
